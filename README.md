# Checker's Game

## Introduction

The Checker's Game is a game that consists of a board with 64 squares, 32 of which are occupied by 16 black and 16 white pieces. The pieces are placed in the 12 squares closest to each player. The objective of the game is to capture all the opponent's pieces or to block them so that they cannot move. There are many variations of the game. The rules implemented in this project are based on the international rules but using a 8x8 board.
The game code was developed in javascript and the interface was developed in HTML and CSS.

The main page is the first page that the user sees when they visit the site. It has four buttons, one to start the game, one to see the rules, one to see the options and one to see the results. Once the player has started the game, the the Start Game button will be replaced by a button to restart the game.

### Options Menu

The options menu allows the user to change the game settings. The user can change the sound On/Off and the higlight On/Off. The highlight is the highlight of the possible moves of the selected piece. The sound is the sound of the pieces moving and the sound of the pieces being captured.

The major concerns were the speed to load the images. The images were reduced both in size and optimizila image compressor. The speed increased but it is still a concern in slow phone connection.
So images were converted to jpg format and the quality was reduced.

## Unfixed Bugs

- dragging
  Sometimes the user can drag the background, which is not the desired behavior.

## Features Left to Implement

- The game could be played in two players mode.
- A timer could be added to the game.

## Deployment

- The game was deployed on GitHub pages.
