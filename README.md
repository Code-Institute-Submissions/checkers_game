## Testing

The website was tested on a desktop computer and a mobile phone.
Also, W3C and Jigsaw validation was used to validate the website HTML and CSS.

W3C Validation:

The major concerns were the speed to load the images. The images were reduced both in size and optimizila image compressor. The speed increased but it is still a concern in slow phone connection.
So images were converted to jpg format and the quality was reduced.

### Unfixed Bugs

<!-- Could not find a way to make a button to return to the page after openning a full size image. -->
